 /**
Using regexes like /coding/, you can look for the pattern coding in another string.

This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern. 
You can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: |.

This operator matches patterns either before or after it. For example, if you wanted to
 match the strings yes or no, the regex you want is /yes|no/.

You can also search for more than just two patterns. You can do this by adding more 
patterns with more OR operators separating them, like /yes|no|maybe/.

 *                         Ignore Case While Matching
 * ********************************************************************
Up until now, you've looked at regexes to do literal matches of strings. But sometimes, 
you might want to also match case differences.

Case (or sometimes letter case) is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase
 letters. Examples of uppercase are A, B, and C. Examples of lowercase are a, b, and c.

You can match both cases using what is called a flag. There are other flags but here you'll
 focus on the flag that ignores case - the i flag. You can use it by appending it to the 
 regex. An example of using this flag is /ignorecase/i. This regex can match the strings 
 ignorecase, igNoreCase, and IgnoreCase.
